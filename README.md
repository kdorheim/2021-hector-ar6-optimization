# 2021-hector-ar6-optimization
Hector investigation for optimizing parameters related to better fitting AR6 RF. 

As part of the update to AR6 RF there were a hanful of parameters that needed to be optmized these included 

* Natural CH4 (to match CH4 concentrations)
* Natural N2O (to match N2O concentrations)
* Beta (to match CO2 concentrations)
* ~~Natural SO2 until it was determined that this parameter is no longer needed as a part of Hector~~
